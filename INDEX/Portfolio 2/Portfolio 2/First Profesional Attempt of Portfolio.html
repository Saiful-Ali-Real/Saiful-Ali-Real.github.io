  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am an up-and-coming Marketing Data Analyst who is passionate about data and the value it brings to businesses.
    Growing up, I didn't have a strong technological background and preferred physical tasks. However, after realizing
    the direction our world is heading, I knew I had to adapt.

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MatPlotLib Projects</a> <br>
This was my first project which I did for the Sheffield Sharks at placement. I was given the role of a Marketing Data Analyst
I used pandas to extract data from a given csv file on excel and using the pandas in python I was able to make grahps using MatPlotLib

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implementing the Sheffield Sharks data into HTML, CSS and JavaScript</a> <br>
Since I had obtained and cleaned the data and had already made a visualisation, I wanted to convert the visualisation into a more convenient and accessible Illustration
This had many more improvements comapred to a simple screenshots. For example now, when the cursor hovers over a a bar it will illustrate the data the bar is showing in a small container.

target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I have now Implementing the Sheffield Sharks data into HTML, CSS and JavaScript with multiple graphs on a single page </a> <br>
Since I could make a single graph on a webpage, I decided to try Implement multiple charts on a single webpage.
These are the same size and have the same features just different data.
